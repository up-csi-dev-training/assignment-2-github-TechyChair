Youtiful by Stray Kids :D
Released 2023

Lookin' at yourself
A lot goes in your mind
"I don't know if I'm ready to show myself"
You worry day and night
Look at the stars fall
They leave the sky, goodbai
Must be an oracle, like a waterfal
They shower you with love tonight

'Cause you are
You're perfect in my eyes
You are
Don't ever dubt yourself
(You are) I know that feeling too, I've been inside the dark
I've never been so empty, hopeless
(You are) But no, it isn't true
'Cause knuw that all the stars are by your side

You know whenever there's a chance
I'll tell you that you're amzing as you are
'Cause when you give me a glance
I'm sure that I see the universe in your eyes
Don't you ever tell yorself that you're not enough
I am certain that you're truly fine
You are a miracle, mracle
You are __________ (clue title ng song)
